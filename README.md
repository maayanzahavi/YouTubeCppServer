# C++ Server

## How to Run the Server

To run the C++ server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to the Server Directory**: Open a terminal in the cloned folder.
3. **Run the Server**: Execute the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   ./server
## Work Distribution

We approached this project collaboratively, working together on each part of the development process:

- **Recommendation Algorithm**: We began by understanding how the recommendation algorithm works. This was crucial for the server's functionality, ensuring it can provide accurate video recommendations.
- **Server Creation**: After understanding the algorithm, we designed and developed the C++ server. We applied knowledge from the lectures to decide on the structure and how to implement the necessary code.
- **API Integration**: Once the server was up and running, we integrated its functionality with the React frontend and the Android application. This included creating the necessary API requests to fetch recommended videos and ensuring smooth communication between the server and the clients.
- **Testing and Validation**: Finally, we thoroughly tested the server by running it in both the React frontend and the Android application. We verified that the server returns the correct recommended videos, ensuring everything works as expected.
